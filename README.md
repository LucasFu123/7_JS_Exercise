`name` is already defined as `jAKE`.

Correctly capitalize the name; change the capitalization of the characters.

The first character of the name should be upperclass `'J'`, and the rest of the name should all be lowercase.

- `firstChar` should be equals to `'j'`
- `upperCaseFirstChar` should be equals to `'J'`
- `restOfName` should be equals to `'ake'`
- `capitalizedName` should be equals to `'Jake'`
